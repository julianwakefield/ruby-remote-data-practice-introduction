# Getting Data from Remote Sources - Scraping

Many companies and organizations make their data
available through a public API - all we need is
a URL and a bit of code to get it. 

Sometimes, though, data we need is not available 
in an API, but _is_ publicly available online 
somewhere. In these cases, we have an additional
tool to help us - _scraping_. Scraping is the process
of taking a website and turning it into objects you
can use in your code. In the next few lessons,
we will take a look at:

* What scraping is
* How to scrape a website using Nokogiri
* How to organize scraped content in an object-oriented
  application
